          I'm a Muslim software engineer now {new Date().getFullYear() - 2004} years old and based
          in Indonesia, I'm highly specialized in web development (full stack) and a bit of mobile
          development. Currently I am studying Informatics Engineering at{' '}
          <a href="https://stt-wastukancana.ac.id" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            STT Wastukancana

          , while also working at{' '}
          <a href="https://pratama.tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            PT. Pratama Solusi Teknologi

          as Head of Software Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alhamdulillah, at this time I use various technologies to facilitate the development
          process, when working on clients, what I often use are PHP, JavaScript and TypeScript. For
          databases, I am most experienced in MySQL, the rest I have used MongoDB, SQLite3 and
          PostgreSQL.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also very interested in linux server configurations especially for (primitive) web
          servers, I'm just learning Python for Numerical Methods and so far I'm quite liking it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from programming, I also like to read books on self-development, Islamic motivation,
          and so on, including story books/history of former pious people. However, I don't really
          like watching movies and listening to music, at least about music, I listen to religious
          music such as prayers or praises to the Prophet Muhammad SAW.
