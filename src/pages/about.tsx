            I'm a Muslim software engineer now {dayjs().year() - 2004} years old and based in
            Indonesia. I'm highly specialized in web development (full stack) and a bit of mobile
            development. Currently, I am studying informatics engineering at{' '}

          <p>
            Alhamdulillah, currently I use various technologies to facilitate the development
            process when working on clients. The technologies that I often use are PHP, both
            natively and with the CodeIgniter 4 framework, JavaScript using Express.js or Fastify,
            and TypeScript with the AdonisJS framework. For databases, I am most experienced in
            MySQL; for the rest, I have used MongoDB, SQLite3, and RethinkDB.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm also interested in linux server configuration; it's a little more difficult with web
            server configuration, such as Nginx or Apache, but it's a challenge for me. I recently
            learned Python for a Numerical Methods course in college, and I'm pretty happy with it
            so far.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regarding the device I use, I use Windows 11 with WSL2, which is a must for me because I
            mostly use the CLI and, of course, Linux. I usually use Ubuntu both on my local machine
            and the servers that I use.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apart from programming, I also like to read books on self-development, Islamic
            motivation, and so on, including stories about or histories of past pious people, and of
            course what I have to read every day, the Qur'an. But you might be sorry because I don't
            like watching movies or listening to music; at the very least, I only listen to
            religious music such as prayers or praises to the Prophet Muhammad SAW.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to connect more with me, I have several social media accounts that you can
            check out on my <Link href="/contact">/contact</Link> page.

          <p>Alhamdulillah, my introduction is enough here.</p>
